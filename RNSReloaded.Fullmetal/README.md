# Fullmetal

**Limits online play.**

For the truly dedicated.
Every encounter and area will now be visited. Gold and EXP are rebalanced.

## Important Notes
- This is meant to be an accompaniment to Steelheart
- Do not use toybox with this mod. If the game crashes on start, try starting a regular game in vanilla, then relaunching Fullmetal
- Does not support choosing starting area. Just use Pale Keep
- Overall gold and EXP will be more than a normal run. This is inevitable due to rounding
- Topaz Charm, Gold Potions, and Tanzakus are more useful
- Health bars in encounters with multiple enemies are known to desync. This is mainly a visual thing and shouldn't affect gameplay too much

# Details
## Hallways
"Areas" refer to the five destinations that can be chosen from the map: Scholar's Nest, King's Arsenal, Red Darkhouse, Churchmouse Streets, and Emerald Lakeside.

Because of hallway limitations, there are still 6 hallways in Fullmetal. However, all areas are included.
Where Hallway 2 would usually contain one area, it contains 2 in Fullmetal. This is also true for Hallway 3. Hallway 4 contains 1 area.

Hallway 1: Outskirts
Hallway 2: Areas 1 & 2
Hallway 3: Areas 3 & 4
Hallway 4: Area 5
Hallway 5: Pale Keep
Hallway 6: Moonlit Pinnacle

In the final route display of the game, only the first areas of each hallway is shown. That would be Outskirts, Area 1, Area 3, Area 5, and Pale Keep.

## Transitions
When transitioning between the two areas in Hallways 2 and 3, the animation can be startling.
The game will not play a long title show, but only move you as if entering another battle.
Fullmetal will transition the background and music, but the name of the hallway (top left) will remain the same as the first area in the hallway.

## Shops and Treasurespheres
The amount of Treasurespheres is the same as a regular run. There are an increased amount of Shops, one at the beginning of each area, including Pale Keep.
In order to ensure that Fullmetal's DPS checks are not steeply more difficult than a regular game, the treasurespheres are placed in relatively similar locations in terms of enemy levels.
To see the exact placement of Treasurespheres, see the Enemy Levels section.

## Rewards
In order to balance the Gold and EXP rewards, they are scaled down so the final total amount will be closer to that of a regular run. For fairness, numbers are rounded up.
Overall Gold and EXP will be more than a normal run. This is inevitable due to the rounding.

Because of increased number of encounters, Topaz Charm and Gold Potions will have more opportunities to give gold.
Tanzakus, Butterfly Ocarina, and Blue Rose are more useful as they also have more opportunities to process.

The exact scaling is based on the ratio of enemies in Fullmetal compared to that of a regular run.
This is determined per hallway, so Hallway 3 will have different balancing than Hallways 1 and 2.

Outskirts: 3 enemies / 10 enemies
Hallways 2/3: 4 enemies / 12 enemies
Hallway 4: 4 enemies / 6 enemies
Pale Keep: 3 enemies / 5 enemies
Moonlight Pinnacle: 1 enemy / 1 enemy

# Enemy Levels
Enemy levels in certain areas are made to match the same levels in a normal game.
Fullmetal Areas 1, 3, 5 map to default 1, 2, 3 respectively.
Kingdom Outskirts, Pale Keep, and Moonlit Pinnacle are made to match their correspondents as well.
Areas 2 and 4 in Fullmetal act as filler, bridging the level gap that typically exists between areas.

Level scaling between encounters is typical, which increases one level per notch.
The only deviation is in Outskirts, where in default Outskirts, levels increase twice per enemy.
In Fullmetal, each notch still increases the enemy level by 1.
