**Limits online play.**

A series of 0 custom fights against the frogs!  
Find your best 3 friends (or worst 3 enemies) and challenge yourselves to beat these lunar+ fights.

This mod is intended for 4 players on lunar difficulty. While other difficulties will work, treat them as a practice mode for the real mod.
Most fights will not work at all with below 4 players - they'll either be incredibly easy or incredibly hard. So make sure you have a full party before setting out.

To ensure fight balance is maintained, loot and shops are not included in the mod - everything will be played with your base kit. Luckily, you start with an item that heals you for 1 HP after each fight (unless you have a floof ball equipped, as an extra challenge)
